What is Serverless?



The Purpose of serverless?

is to make you focus on making your software

There are Two Type.

 1. Function as Service(FAAS)
 2. Backend as Service(BAAS)

- Function as Service

    is a type of cloud-computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events without the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching microservices applications.(https://www.ibm.com/id-en/topics/faas)

in AWS you will use
AWS Lambda let you run code without provisioning or managing server

- Backend As Service

    The software that we see and interact with is the frontend part, but the backend is the part that handles all of the technical work of the software including database management, cloud storage, user authentication, push notifications, hosting, and many more.

Note: 
    There is also Mobile-Backend-as-Service(MBASS)

    Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) is BaaS intended specifically for building apps for mobile. While some sources consider BaaS and MBaaS to be basically interchangeable terms, BaaS services do not necessarily have to be used for building mobile applications.

-- BaaS providers offer a number of server-side capabilities. For instance:

    1.Database management
    2. Cloud storage (for user-generated content)
    3. User authentication
    4. Push notifications
    5. Remote updating
    6. Hosting
    7. Other platform- or vendor-specific functionalities; for instance, Firebase offers Google 
    8.search indexing
    9. BaaS and MBaaS providers include Google Firebase and Microsoft Azure.
